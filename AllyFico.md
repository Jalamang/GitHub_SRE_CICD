***1. Can you explain your understanding of DevOps and how it differs from traditional software development methodologies?***
   
  ## Traditional SDLC

    When talking about the traditional SDLC, we often refer to the Waterfall approach because it is considered the earliest and most widely utilized methodology.

    In the software development life cycle, the Waterfall model is used to design a system linearly and sequentially. This model is known as Waterfall because it advances in a systematic downward manner from one phase to the next. The output of one step is used as the input for the following one.

    One of the model's key features is that each phase must be completed before the next one can begin, and the phases must not overlap.

    Unlike the DevOps software development era, the traditional SDLC followed a process where you had separate departments that were individually responsible for developing, testing and delivering. Consequently, a successful project delivery mainly relies on effective interdepartmental collaboration. This could be difficult to attain if you have remote teams or have outsourced some of your operations to third-party vendors.

   -   merge conflicts were higher. 
   -   post-production flaws.
    
## DevOps software development

    DevOps is a cultural and operational approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams in order to improve the speed and quality of software delivery. It includes practices such as continuous integration and continuous deployment. This ensures you always have a ready-to-deploy build.

    It's an endless cycle consisting of the following steps: plan, code, build and test, release, deploy, operate, monitor, give feedback, and finally reset the loop.

    The developers write code that fulfills the requirements and then deploy the application. To align software with expectations, stakeholders and developers must effectively communicate about their project and its requirements.

    All the necessary changes in the software are automatically merged, tested and deployed to a suitable production environment. When comparing traditional software development vs DevOps this process involves fewer efforts required to coordinate between different departments.

    

***2. How do you use tools such as Git, Jenkins, and Ansible to automate the software development and deployment process?***

    Git, Jenkins, and Ansible are tools that can be used together to automate various aspects of the software development and deployment process. Here's a high-level overview of how they can be used:
